##About LinkJVM
LinkJVM is a Java Environment of the [KIPR Link](http://www.kipr.org/products/link/) and allows the execution of very Java language and acually very JVM supported language such as Scala and Javascript (over [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Rhino)).

+ Add the linkjvm-metalayer [meta-linkjvm](https://github.com/LinkJVM/meta-linkjvm) to the buildserver.
+ Build LinkJVM
